//The Document Object Model, or DOM, is essentially the elements you write into your HTML. DOMSelectors allow you to easily access your HTML in JS.

// DOMSelectors are objects that hold access to the DOM that you can call upon easily at any point in your code.

const DOMSelectors = {
  button: document.getElementById("btn"), // getElementById looks for the id that is passed through it, in this case being "btn"
  text: document.querySelector("#text"), // queryselectors look for elements based on parameters, being '.' or '#'
  box: document.getElementById("big-black-box"),
  points: document.querySelectorAll(".point"), // querySelectorAll will access multiple elements with the same class, in this case being "point"
};

console.log(DOMSelectors.box);
console.log(DOMSelectors.button);

console.log(DOMSelectors.points);
console.log(DOMSelectors.points[0]); // this returns the first ever element in the document with class 'point'
console.log(DOMSelectors.null);
console.log(DOMSelectors.nothing);
// when you look in the console after logging DOMSelectors, you will be able to see the elements that the DOMSelector accesses.
// if you have a DOMSelector for an element that doesn't exist, it will show up as undefined.

}

//   Event Listeners wait for a specified event to happen to an element, and then execute code when their conditions are met

DOMSelectors.button.addEventListener("click", function () {

// eventlisteners can be applied to any element, and any amount of elements

    el.addEventListener("click", function () {
      el.innerHTML = `${i}`; // you can use template literals in DOMSelectors as well!

}

changeLi(); // will set the <li> value to 0 on first click, and the value will increase by 1 every time an <li> is clicked.

//since all the list elements share the same class, they also share the same value when defined in js, which will cause a sudden jump if you're clicking on one <li> element and then switch to clicking another.
